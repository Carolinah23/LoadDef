# No Gravity Case:

** 23 June 2017:
- Modified fluid-solid and solid-fluid boundaries based 
on Takeuchi & Saito (1972) pgs. 253-255
- Removed all terms involving "g" (gravity), "ond" (since
its not really used yet anyway), and "y5" and "y6" based 
on Takeuchi & Saito (1972) eq. 91
- Modified the homogeneous-sphere starting solutions 
based on Takeuchi & Saito (1972) eqs. 104 and 105; note
that the equation for k (eq. 99) reduces to (omega/alpha)
or (omega/beta), depending on +/- sign, when gamma is set
to zero. The built-in python function for spherical bessel 
functions proved to be less stable than the series (Eq. 103)
from Takeuchi & Saito (1972).
- I have started modifying boundary conditions by removing
Y5 and Y6, and the external gravitational BC, which has to
do with Poisson's equation.
- I am not sure how to handle the n=1 case; results seem to 
be very far off from reasonable, probably because we are 
missing some constraint on the motion/position of the center
of mass of the system.

# !! Not appropriate/possible to integrate through liquid outer core in case of no self-gravity !!
# The transition from fluid core to solid mantle yields solution vectors with zeros in multiple
# fields and it is not possible to continue integrating to the surface.
# As per conversation with Martin van Driel (July 2018) and reference to paper(s) by David Al Attar,
# it is not appropriate to include the core regions when excluding gravity from the problem.
# Hence, I will start integration from the CMB.
# Typically, I think, this testing will only be used for homogeneous spheres anyway. 
 
# NOTE: NOT SURE IF I NEED TO ADJUST THE ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTIONS FOR H and L
# PROBABLY... BUT THE SOLUTIONS SEEM TO MATCH LLNs COMPUTED DIRECTLY AT HIGH N
# SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS FURTHER...
