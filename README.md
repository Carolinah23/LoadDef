# LoadDef

A Python-based toolkit to model elastic deformation caused by surface mass loading on spherically symmetric bodies.

## Attribution:

The LoadDef software is largely a product of Hilary Martens’s PhD research work at Caltech in collaboration with Mark
Simons (Caltech) and Luis Rivera (Universite de Strasbourg). We distribute the software free of charge with
the hope that you may find it useful in your own research and educational pursuits. In the normal scientific
practice, we request that you recognize the efforts of the authors by citing appropriate peer-reviewed
paper(s) in presentations and publications (see list below) and we welcome opportunities for collaboration. Please
feel free to reach out with any questions you may have about the software or its applications. 

### To acknowledge use of this software, please cite the following publication:

by surface mass loading on spherically symmetric bodies. Earth and Space Science, 6. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018ea000462.

We also welcome opportunities to collaborate as co-author(s) on project applications that make use of LoadDef, and we aim to
continue supporting and developing LoadDef based on community input. If you have any questions about the software or would 
like to discuss a particular project idea further, please get in touch! Thanks!
